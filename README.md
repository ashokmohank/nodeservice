Configurable Workflow Management API

Define Process workflows dynamically and track tasks based on due-date
Sign-Off the tasks in the workflow through emails

Stages of Configurations:
1. Define Status and Sequence (Status Set)
2. Define Workflow based on the status-set
3. Create tasks based on the Workflows

Each flow would have assignee, owner and due-dates. Parallel levels of aprovals are also permitted.
